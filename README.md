**Interactive Tic Tac Toe Game**
Tutorial - https://legacy.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

A tic tac toe game that allows users to play a game of tictactoe, notifies them of the winner, and allows users to view game history and revert the game back to previous versions. It allowed me to learn some of the fundamentals of React and how it works including the syntax, common techniques used, and basic terminology.
